# 🎂 KIM-1 Demo Project

A small but heartfelt demo celebrating the **50th birthday of the legendary MOS KIM-1** 🖥️✨

The **KIM-1** first became available in **January 1976** —  
*three months before the Apple I 🍎* and *one month after its sibling, the TIM*.  
An incredible milestone in early microcomputer history!

For this demo, I’ve gathered and connected a few components that were scattered across my repositories 🧩.  
The goal is not just to look back, but to **celebrate, experiment, and build together**.

I warmly invite fellow retro-computing enthusiasts and comrades-in-arms 🤝  
to jump in, contribute ideas, add modules, demos, or improvements, and help this project grow.

Let’s keep the spirit of early computing alive 🚀

🎉 **HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KIM-1!** 🎉  
Wishing you — and all of us — a fantastic and hacky **Year 2026** 🥳✨
